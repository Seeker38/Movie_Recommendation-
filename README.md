# movie recommendations by Hector Truong(Seeker)

Project that recommend users on the pretrain data, to theirs personal movie predictions.
The project contains 3 ways to appoarch: using hybrid, ALS, Deep Learning.


## Building project

Ensure that you have conda, python, and all nessary libraries.
If you use ALS, make sure java 8.





File (make sure you change the input and output path):
1. For model training using pyspark ALS --> ALS.ipynb
2. For the presave model used for ALS--> main.ipynb
2. For model training using Hybrid model (more like base on contents )--> ALS.ipynb



## NOTES
1. The data is missing quite a bit because the size is too big for github free account. So you need to go to (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data) for full download.
2. the training model for deep learing (tfrs.h5) is over 50mb so i can't upload it. You can mail me if you need it though.
